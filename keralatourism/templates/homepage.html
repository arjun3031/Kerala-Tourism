            <h2>Geographical Features of Kerala</h2>
<p><strong>Kerala</strong>, located on the southwestern coast of India, is renowned for its unique and diverse geographical features.Kerala covers an area of approximately 38,863 square kilometers (15,005 square miles). It is a relatively small state compared to other Indian states but is renowned for its rich natural resources and scenic beauty. </p>        
        

    <h3 class="f">Forest's</h3>
<p>Kerala's landscape is characterized by its lush green forests, which cover around 20% of the state's area. The Western Ghats, a mountain range running parallel to the eastern border, are home to dense tropical rainforests and are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Major forest areas include the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary, Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, and Silent Valley National Park.</p>
<h3 class="f">River's</h3>
<p>Kerala is crisscrossed by 44 rivers, primarily originating from the Western Ghats. Notable rivers include the Periyar, which is the longest river in Kerala, as well as the Bharathapuzha, Pamba, and Kabini rivers. These rivers play a crucial role in the stateâ€™s agriculture and provide vital water resources.</p>
<h3 class="f">Costal area's</h3>
<p>Kerala has a long coastline stretching about 580 kilometers (360 miles) along the Arabian Sea. This coastal area is dotted with beautiful beaches, backwaters, and lagoons, which are a major attraction for tourists. Prominent beaches include Kovalam, Varkala, and Alappuzha, while the backwaters are famously navigated by houseboats in areas like Alleppey (Alappuzha) and Kumarakom.</p>
<h3 class="f">Backwater's</h3>
<p>Kerala's backwaters are a unique and enchanting network of interconnected canals, rivers, lakes, and lagoons. These serene and picturesque waterways span over 900 kilometers along the coastal region of the state, providing a tranquil escape into nature. <br>
    The Kerala backwaters are a network of brackish lagoons and canals lying parallel to the Arabian Sea of the Malabar coast of Kerala state in south-western India. It also includes interconnected lakes, rivers, and inlets, a labyrinthine system formed by more than 900 km (560 mi) of waterways, and sometimes compared to bayous. The network includes five large lakes linked by canals, both man made and natural, fed by 38 rivers, and extending virtually half the length of Kerala state. The backwaters were formed by the action of waves and shore currents creating low barrier islands across the mouths of the many rivers flowing down from the Western Ghats range. In the midst of this landscape there are a number of towns and cities, which serve as the starting and end points of backwater cruises. <br>
     There are 34 backwaters in Kerala. Out of it, 27 are located either closer to Arabian Sea or parallel to the sea. The remaining 7 are inland navigation routes. <br>

    The backwaters have a unique ecosystem: freshwater from the rivers meets the seawater from the Arabian Sea. A barrage has been built near Thanneermukkom, so salt water from the sea is prevented from entering the deep inside, keeping the fresh water intact. Such fresh water is extensively used for irrigation purposes. Many unique species of aquatic life including crabs, frogs and mudskippers, water birds such as terns, kingfishers, darters and cormorants, and animals such as otters and turtles live in and alongside the backwaters. Palm trees, pandanus shrubs, various leafy plants, and bushes grow alongside the backwaters, providing a green hue to the surrounding landscape.</p>
<h3 class="f">Climates's</h3>
<p>Kerala experiences a tropical monsoon climate, characterized by high humidity and significant rainfall. The state has three distinct seasons: <br><br>
    <strong>Monsoon </strong>(June to September):  The southwest monsoon brings heavy rains, which are crucial for replenishing water resources and supporting agriculture. <br>
   <strong>Post-Monsoon  </strong>(October to November): This period is marked by lighter rains and relatively cooler temperatures. <br>
  <strong> Dry Season</strong> (December to May):  The weather is generally warm and dry, with temperatures ranging from 25Â°C to 35Â°C (77Â°F to 95Â°F). The northeastern monsoon in October and November also contributes to the rainfall in this season.</p></div>
